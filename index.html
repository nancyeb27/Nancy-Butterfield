            <p>Hi!</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for visiting my website, I am happy you are here. </p>

            <p> My name is Nancy, I am a technical professional with a passion for creating. </p>

            <p> I am a Multi-talented Web Developer able to rapidly adopt new technologies and concepts 
                with a background in web development, meeting planning, finance, live theater, and database management. 
                Resourceful problem-solver with exceptional communication and conflict resolution skills. 
                Successful working in a fast-paced environment and working directly with the public as an information source. 
                Excellent communicator with effective client relationship-building skills.  </p>

             <p> I am a proud Denver native and graduate of both The University of Denver Womenâ€™s College
                  and University College with a BA in Communications and a Certificate from the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
                </p>
              
             <p> I love live theater, volunteering, enjoying time in the beautiful Colorado outdoors and traveling. </p>

             <p> I hope to combine my my past experience and passion for coding working for a company that does good things for people;
                 whether that be making a great product that is needed or working to solve some of the current problems we have in our society.
                </p>
